Subject: Last chance: Limited stock available

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick heads-up: We're running low on inventory for [Popular Product].

If {{company}} is interested in stocking this for the upcoming season, I'd recommend placing an order soon.

We're expecting to be out of stock by end of month, and next production run isn't until [Date].

Let me know if you'd like to secure an order before we run out.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. I can hold 50 units for {{company}} if you need time to decide.
